# SimpleBloodDecalMod
This is a simple mod for Minecraft 1.19.2 that gives entities a chance to bleed red particles, and have a blood decal appear on the floor after being attacked.

The Particles are a bit small, but I hope I made this so it doesn't get in the way of visibility.

I made this mod to give the player/user to add a bit more of a immersive expirience when using horror mods, other gore related mods. 

Just note; I did make the skeleton to not bleed because I thought it would be too weird. Also, due to the limitations of Minecraft's engine and how the gravity works. Sometimes hitting an entity causes the "decal" to float in the air. This could be due to how the suppesed, "decal" is a 3D custom model and Minecraft doesn't like custom models with gravity, so it justs seems to float in the air sometimes.
